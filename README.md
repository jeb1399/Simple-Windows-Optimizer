# What it is.

Just a simple windows optimizer that works with windows 10. Its a small batch script you can trust because I dont even know how to obfuscate that kind of stuff.

# What it does.

Both of these scripts have a collection of services, software, and registry entries to disable, modify, or delete including the most common to stuff you wouldnt normally find in these kind of scripts.

# "Windows protected your PC" error fix

To fix this just click "More info" and click "Run anyway". This shows up because the script makes a few registry edits and deletes some old and unused system files which windows doesnt like.

# **HEY!**

Newer versions disable even **more**!

# Problems?

**Deal with it**
